:::important Washing of overalls.

Use non bio washing powder to retain fire retarding property of the cotton. Someone on a heritage railway went underneath the ashpan and a piece of ash set fire to his overalls which had been washed in biological powder

Do not use fabric conditioner or overalls will turn purple rather than fade to light blue

## Basic Hand Care

Hand care is important, the following two products will help you look after your hands, they are important as a fireman, without them you canâ€™t do your job. 

[Barrier Cream](https://www.ebay.co.uk/itm/225219854398?var=524157679613)

A stout leather belt can be worn with the bib and brace to stop it getting too baggy when bending

Fluids- always bring at least 1 litre of water or squash in a plastic bottle or metal vacuum flask. I freeze the bottles in the freezer and stick them on the cab handrails or in a bucket of cold water to keep cool. Drink this and top up bottle during the day and take on any fluids hot or cold offered during the day. Drink fluids at an enhanced rate better to keep needing to wee than go down with heat exhaustion.

## Gloves

:::important Glove discipline 
Rigger or black gloves must not be used for oily jobs or that will be transferred to handrails and controls and everyone picks it up
:::

Rigger gloves can be worn for firing but they donâ€™t have a good grip on the shovel. Useful for handling fire irons.

PVC gloves - use for coupling and uncoupling, oiling up, lighting up and engine cleaning.  [https://www.toolstation.com/pvc-knit-wrist-gloves/p44494](https://www.toolstation.com/pvc-knit-wrist-gloves/p44494)

Mechanics gloves thin black- have used them for firing good feel and take heat reasonably.
